keywords: android EditText setTextColor alpha

This is a simple demo for setting the alpha of text in a textview.
It uses getCurrentTextColor and setColor so it could be used for
setting text color as well as just the alpha.

It consists of an EditText and a button.  The button steps
through setting the alpha from its initial value to 
0%, 25%, 50% and 100%.
